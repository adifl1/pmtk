*Obtaining Parameters*

m.params always returns a distribution over all of the model parameters: these may be
stored as a product of const dists if they are only point estimates. If the distributions factor, these are stored as a product dist. If not, m.params is a single distribution, e.g. an mvninvwishartdist. 


m.params.paramname returns the distribution over the parameter paramname. If this is a const dist, it is automatically unwrapped.


Calling e.g. m.mu directly returns a point estimate of mu, specifically mode(m.params.mu). 
However, if a joint distribution is defined over both mu and sigma, then a warning is issued. The user must call, e.g. mode(marginal(m.params,'mu')) explicitly. 

Suppose we have a joint distribution over both mu and Sigma in the mvn case. The user is disallowed from typing m.params.mu since it is ambiguous as to whether he or she wants the marginal distribution over mu, (an mvtdist) or the mu parameter of the mvninvwishartdist. 
This syntax is only allowed in the case that the distribution over parameters factorizes, i.e. when m.params is a productDist. We enforce this via the get.params interceptor in the ParamDist superclass, (not to be confused with the getParams method).
