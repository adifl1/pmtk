*fit method*

fit should support the following string options:

'suffStat'     - pass in sufficient stats made by mkSuffStat() instead of data

'data'         - the data to fit with if only one kind

'inputData'  

'outputData'   - if there are two kinds of data, e.g. X,y in LinregDist

'prior'        - a prior on the parameters of the distribution. 


*predict method*

predict method for unconditional densities should return posterior predictive distribution. This is just the object itself if it was fit via map or mle. 


*other*

All ProbDist objects can be created, (empty) without passing in any parameters
