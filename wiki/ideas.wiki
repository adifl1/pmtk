(1) No more vectorized distributions - use product dist subclasses instead
betaProdDist,...

(2) We implement get interceptors for parameters so that the user can ask for obj.mu or     obj.sigma and if they are stored as a joint distribution, the user gets the marginal. We also have a marginal method in the super class, which does the same thing. Additionally it  supports multiple queries. 

(3) Marginal anywhere (lives in probdist)

(4) Predict for unconditional dist

(4)remove VecDist and MatrixDist and ScalarDist 

(5) ConstDist not necessary anymore
