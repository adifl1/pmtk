  # Use Bishop's data for logregDist.demoVisualizePredictive, use both L1, L2 and cross validate lambda
  # Change logregDist interface so that the user decides when fitting, whether to use point estimation(default) or full Bayesian.
  # Move all static demos to their own source files
  # Setup auto generation of documentation via publish
  # Setup google analytics for pmtk google code site
  # Add a delta distribution class with basic ops like mean, mode and use it with logregDist
  # Finish SVM vs logreg demo (need to find a faster way to perform cv with L1 - maybe emlmex of L1GeneralProjection.m ?)
  # Abstract out scoring function for cross validation, add BIC functionality
  # Combine all inferParams with fit methods and all postPredict with predict methods
  # Investigate IRLS-lars as a default for L1 logreg on small problems (compare to projection - waiting to hear back from author)
  # Add L1L2 Elastic net code to linreg class
  # Transformer for y-data in classification cases (or enhanced oneOfK function)
  # Look into auto lambda generation (smallest singular value heuristic? scaling by N, lars?
  # Implement generative classifier super class
  # Naive Bayes subclass of abive
  # MVN classifier subclass of above
  # NB vs LR comparison demos (minka fig 5,6 - advantage of being Bayesian w.r.t n) - wrt n and d
  # KNN class
  # speed up dist2 function via batch processing/bsxfun
  # KNN demo (mnist performance as we vary the training set size)
