= PMTK TODO LIST =

*This page stores a running list of current high priority development items.*



*Before NIPS*

(1) Consistent interface (params field, getparams, common fit methods, make demos work)
(2) Latex table of models and operations + some interface specs
(3) NIPS slides and Demos for talk
(4) ModelDistribution class + example
(5) Mixture Dists

----
HMMs (port Kevin's code to PMTK) (Make only one class)
----
Make TrellisDist NonParmDist class
----
HMM Casino demo
----
HMM speech recognition demos (use generative models framework)
----
implement the equation for "gamma2" using eqn 13.109
----
Add ProductDist super class and subclasses as needed to handle vectorized
distributions - don't use non product distributions in this way anymore. 
----
Use get interceptors for distribution parameters - each distribution has a 
params field, storing the parameters of the model. Calling m.params returns
either a predefined joint distribution like NIG or a product dist in the case
that the parameters factor. We want to support name driven access like m.params.mu
and have it return the marginal distribution on mu. 
----
Add default getParams() support in probDist
----
Replace constDist usage with get interceptors
----
Refactor generative classifiers to use the productDist objects instead - including NaiveBayesBernoulliDist, NaiveBayesGaussDist, MvnClassifierDist
----
Predict for unconditional distributions (i.e. predict target nodes)
----
re-evaluate logprob for conditional models, e.g. Logreg
----
Mixture of Gaussian's class with EM
----
Gibbs and variational EM for GMMs
----
PMTK GUI proof of concept
----
Add fit/predict interface to Model Selection class.
----
rewrite demo Post Models Exhaustive using ModelSelection class
----
Demo custom search function for Model Selection class
----
Prepare Demos slides and code for NIPS talk
----
latex table where each row is one of the classes we have,
and we have columsn specifiying if each model defines X, Y, Z (and
what dimensionality),
and what the various fit/ predict methods do, and what optional args
they support.
----
Comment demos and classes
----
Finish SVM vs logreg demo 
----
Write a script to autogenerate an external source table:
filename      url      author      modified
----
Look into auto lambda generation (smallest singular value heuristic? scaling by N, 
lars?
----
KNN class
----
speed up dist2 function via batch processing/bsxfun
----
KNN demo (mnist performance as we vary the training set size)
----
Look into running compiled matlab on <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>
----
