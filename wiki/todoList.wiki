= PMTK TODO LIST =

*This page stores a running list of current high priority development items.*

----
HMM - fitting fully observed data & trellis prediction of future data
----
implement the equation for "gamma2" using eqn 13.109
----
Refactor generative classifiers to use the productDist objects instead - including NaiveBayesBernoulliDist, NaiveBayesGaussDist, MvnClassifierDist
----
Predict for unconditional distributions (i.e. predict target nodes)
----
Mixture Distributions (fit via EM)
----
Gibbs and variational EM for GMMs
----
PMTK GUI proof of concept
----
Demo custom search function for Model Dist class
----
latex table where each row is one of the classes we have,
and we have columsn specifiying if each model defines X, Y, Z (and
what dimensionality),
and what the various fit/ predict methods do, and what optional args
they support.
----
Comment demos and classes
----
Finish SVM vs logreg demo 
----
Look into auto lambda generation (smallest singular value heuristic? scaling by N, 
lars?
----
KNN class
----
speed up dist2 function via batch processing/bsxfun
----
KNN demo (mnist performance as we vary the training set size)
----
Look into running compiled matlab on <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>
----

*recently completed items*

----
~~Use Bishop's data for logregDist.demoVisualizePredictive, use both L1, L2 and cross validate lambda~~
----
~~Change logregDist interface so that the user decides when fitting, whether to use point estimation(default) or full Bayesian.~~
----
~~Move all static demos to their own source files~~
----
~~Setup auto generation of documentation via publish~~
----
~~Improve the auto generated documentation~~
----
~~Remove @ directories from PMTK~~

~~rewrite viewClassTree to work with the new @less naming convention~~
----
~~Setup google analytics for pmtk google code site~~
----
~~Add a delta distribution class with basic ops like mean, mode and use it with logregDist~~
----
~~Exclude trivial functions from PMTK documentation list~~
----
~~Naming convention changes: capitalize class names; add Dist to the end of the graphical model classes, use mix prefix for mixture models~~
----
~~Remove deltaDist class and use constDist class instead.~~
----
~~Modify viewClassTree to use short names, e.g. remove Dist from name~~
----
~~Modify Logregdist predict function to return a single argument, either a discretedist or a Sampledist. Fixed all demos that depended on this change. Other minor interface changes to predict.~~
----
~~Modify Linregdist predict interface - remove 'exact' , 'plugin' option~~
----
~~Combine all inferParams with fit methods and all postPredict with predict methods~~
----
~~Make Discretedist a subclass of Multinomdist~~
----
~~Debug graphClassDemo and ggmBICdemo~~
----
~~Write a general purpose model selection class, which abstracts scoring and searching~~
----
~~Enhanced OneOfK function to automatically tranform y classification data to the right format~~
----
~~Don't store models twice in model selection class (store sorted indices instead)~~
----
~~PCA Transformer Class~~
----
~~Add L1 L2 Elastic net code to linreg class~~
----
~~Apply NB to binary MNIST and plot class confusion matrix~~
----
~~Solution for representing a product of vector distributions: Product Dist!~~
----
~~Make sure prob dist vectorization semantics is consistent throughout: taken care of by Product Dist~~
----

~~HMMs (port Kevin's code to PMTK) (Make only one class)~~
----
~~Make TrellisDist NonParmDist class~~
----
~~HMM Casino demo~~
----
~~Add ProductDist super class and subclasses as needed to handle vectorized
distributions - don't use non product distributions in this way anymore.~~
----
~~HMM speech recognition demos (use generative models framework)~~
----
~~Add fit/predict interface to Model Selection class.~~
