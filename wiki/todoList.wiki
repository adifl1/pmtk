= PMTK TODO LIST =

This page stores a running list of current high priority development items.


----
~~Use Bishop's data for logregDist.demoVisualizePredictive, use both L1, L2 and cross validate lambda~~
----
~~Change logregDist interface so that the user decides when fitting, whether to use point estimation(default) or full Bayesian.~~
----
~~Move all static demos to their own source files~~
----
~~Setup auto generation of documentation via publish~~
----
~~Improve the auto generated documentation~~
----
~~Remove @ directories from PMTK~~
----
~~Vectorize mkSymmetric function~~
----
~~Remove Private Directories~~
----
~~rewrite viewClassTree to work with the new @less naming convention~~
----
~~Setup google analytics for pmtk google code site~~
----
~~Add a delta distribution class with basic ops like mean, mode and use it with logregDist~~
----
~~Exclude trivial functions from PMTK documentation list~~
----
~~Naming convention changes: capitalize class names; add Dist to the end of the graphical model classes, use mix prefix for mixture models~~
----
~~Remove deltaDist class and use constDist class instead.~~
----
~~Modify viewClassTree to use short names, e.g. remove Dist from name~~
----
~~Modify Logregdist predict function to return a single argument, either a discretedist or a Sampledist. Fixed all demos that depended on this change. Other minor interface changes to predict.~~
----
~~Modify Linregdist predict interface - remove 'exact' , 'plugin' option~~
----
Combine all inferParams with fit methods and all postPredict with predict methods
----
Make DiscreteDist a subclass of MultinomDist
----
Debug graphClassDemo and ggmBICdemo 
----
Abstract out scoring function for cross validation, add BIC functionality
----
Enhanced OneOfK function to automatically tranform y classification data to the right format
----
Implement generative classifier super class
----
Naive Bayes subclass of above
----
MVN classifier subclass of above
----
Finish SVM vs logreg demo (need to find a faster way to perform cv with L1 - maybe emlmex of L1GeneralProjection.m ?) Tried to get emlmex working with L1Projection but may not be possible. 
----
~~Add L1 L2 Elastic net code to linreg class~~
----
Write a script to autogenerate an external source table:
filename      url      author      modified
----
Look into auto lambda generation (smallest singular value heuristic? scaling by N, 
lars?
----
Mixture of Gaussian's class (gibbs sampling)
----
KNN class
----
speed up dist2 function via batch processing/bsxfun
----
KNN demo (mnist performance as we vary the training set size)
----
Look into running compiled matlab on <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>
----
Solution for representing a product of vector distributions
----
