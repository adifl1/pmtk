= PMTK TODO LIST =

This page stores a running list of current high priority development items.


----
~~Use Bishop's data for logregDist.demoVisualizePredictive, use both L1, L2 and cross validate lambda~~
----
~~Change logregDist interface so that the user decides when fitting, whether to use point estimation(default) or full Bayesian.~~
----
~~Move all static demos to their own source files~~
----
~~Setup auto generation of documentation via publish~~
----
~~Improve the auto generated documentation~~
----
~~Remove @ directories from PMTK~~
----
----
~~Remove Private Directories~~
----
~~rewrite viewClassTree to work with the new @less naming convention~~
----
~~Setup google analytics for pmtk google code site~~
----
~~Add a delta distribution class with basic ops like mean, mode and use it with logregDist~~
----
Simplify naming conventions
----
Finish SVM vs logreg demo (need to find a faster way to perform cv with L1 - maybe emlmex of L1GeneralProjection.m ?) Tried to get emlmex working with L1Projection but may not be possible. 
----
Abstract out scoring function for cross validation, add BIC functionality
----
Combine all inferParams with fit methods and all postPredict with predict methods
----
Investigate IRLS-lars as a default for L1 logreg on small problems (compare to 
projection - waiting to hear back from author)
----
Add L1 L2 Elastic net code to linreg class
----
Transformer for y-data in classification cases (or enhanced oneOfK function)
----
Look into auto lambda generation (smallest singular value heuristic? scaling by N, 
lars?
----
Implement generative classifier super class
----
Naive Bayes subclass of abive
----
MVN classifier subclass of above
----
NB vs LR comparison demos (minka fig 5,6 - advantage of being Bayesian w.r.t n) - wrt n and d
----
KNN class
----
speed up dist2 function via batch processing/bsxfun
----
KNN demo (mnist performance as we vary the training set size)
----
Mixture of Gaussian's class (gibbs sampling)
----
