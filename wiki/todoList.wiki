*recently completed items* (oldest to newest)

----
~~Use Bishop's data for logregDist.demoVisualizePredictive, use both L1, L2 and cross validate lambda~~

----
~~Move all static demos to their own source files~~
----
~~Setup auto generation of documentation via publish~~
----
~~Improve the auto generated documentation~~
----
~~Remove @ directories from PMTK~~

~~Remove deltaDist class and use constDist class instead.~~
----
~~Modify viewClassTree to use short names, e.g. remove Dist from name~~

----
~~Write a general purpose model selection class, which abstracts scoring and searching~~
----
~~Enhanced OneOfK function to automatically tranform y classification data to the right format~~
----
~~Don't store models twice in model selection class (store sorted indices instead)~~
----
~~PCA Transformer Class~~
----
~~Add L1 L2 Elastic net code to linreg class~~
----
~~Apply NB to binary MNIST and plot class confusion matrix~~
----
~~Solution for representing a product of vector distributions: Product Dist!~~

----
~~Make TrellisDist NonParmDist class~~
----
~~HMM Casino demo~~
