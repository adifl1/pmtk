= PMTK TODO LIST =

This page stores a running list of current high priority development items.

----
Refactor PMTK to remove VecDist,ScalarDist and MatrixDist superclasses
----
Add ProductDist super class and subclasses as needed to handle vectorized
distributions - don't use non product distributions in this way anymore. 
----
Use get interceptors for distribution parameters
----
Add default marginal() support in probDist
----
Replace constDist usage with get interceptors
----
Refactor generative classifiers to use the productDist objects instead - including NaiveBayesBernoulliDist, NaiveBayesGaussDist, MvnClassifierDist
----
Predict for unconditional distributions (i.e. predict target nodes)
----
Remove logprob from conditional models, use e.g. discrete dist logprob instead. Fix up demos that use this.
----
Mixture of Gaussian's class with EM
----
Gibbs and variational EM for GMMs
----
HMMs (port Kevin's code to PMTK)
----
PMTK GUI proof of concept
----
Add fit/predict interface to Model Selection class.
----
rewrite demo Post Models Exhaustive using ModelSelection class
----
Demo custom search function for Model Selection class
----
Prepare Demos slides and code for NIPS talk
----
Comment demos and classes
----
Finish SVM vs logreg demo 
----
Write a script to autogenerate an external source table:
filename      url      author      modified
----
Look into auto lambda generation (smallest singular value heuristic? scaling by N, 
lars?
----
KNN class
----
speed up dist2 function via batch processing/bsxfun
----
KNN demo (mnist performance as we vary the training set size)
----
Look into running compiled matlab on <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>
----

*recently completed items*
