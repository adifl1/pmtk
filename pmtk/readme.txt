PMTK: Probabilistic Modeling Toolkit
See http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/pmtk/

Run loadPMTK.m to initialize the PMTK path. 

To test that all of the PMTK functionality is working on your system, run the 
runDemos.m script. 

You can add PMTK to your path permanently by typing "pathtool" at the prompt, 
selecting "add with subfolders" and choosing the root PMTK directory. Note, 
however, that the directory structure may change from version to version. Before
upgrading, you should remove the PMTK path entries via pathtool and then 
add them again once the new version is in place.
